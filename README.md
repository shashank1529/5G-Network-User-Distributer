# 5G Network User Distributer Project
The 5G Network User Distributer Project focuses on enhancing communication between user terminals and Base Stations (BS) in 5G networks by leveraging small cell deployments placed in proximity to existing macrocell infrastructures. These small cells provide a cost-effective solution for improving network coverage and data rates, playing a pivotal role in boosting system performance and enhancing network cooperation.

This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation designed to optimize mobile outdoor coverage and overall network capacity while maintaining the user's Quality of Service (QoS). By decoupling the network into separate downlink and uplink layers, the project employs a resource-efficient algorithm to determine optimal user-to-BS associations. The algorithm improves network performance by maximizing data rates, optimizing BS connections, and ensuring the preservation of QoS for all users.

The low-complexity algorithm excels in managing ultra-dense networks, efficiently serving the majority of active users, regardless of network density, while achieving reliable QoS maintenance. This project is an ideal starting point for researchers and developers interested in studying user-centric approaches to 5G network optimization.

## üìö Project Overview


## Introduction

The **5G Network User Distributer Project** addresses the challenges of enhancing communication in 5G networks by adopting a User-Centric (UC) approach. By leveraging small cell deployments in close proximity to macrocell infrastructures, the project aims to improve coverage, data rates, and overall network cooperation.

This project simulates a 5G network environment with advanced algorithms to optimize user-to-Base Station (BS) associations, focusing on:

- **Decoupled Networks**: Separating downlink and uplink layers for better resource management.
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimizing required resource blocks (RBs) for efficient spectrum usage.
- **QoS Preservation**: Maintaining reliable Quality of Service for all active users.
- **Data Rate Enhancements**: Maximizing throughput in ultra-dense network environments.
- **Context Awareness**: Using network context like SINR and RB availability for informed decisions.

This project provides a robust framework for researchers and developers exploring resource-efficient solutions for next-generation network designs.
